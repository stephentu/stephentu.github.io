<h2>Key ideas in basic functional analysis</h2>
<div class="post-desc">

on functional-analysis 

</div>
<div class="post-content">
<p>I recently completed a first year course in functional analysis, and I want
to write down the key takeaways and ideas before I forget them all. This post
will be a brief survey of (a subset of) topics covered.</p>

<p>
More specifically, math textbooks often (in my opinion, as an applied person)
do a poor job of motivating why a particular definition is the right one or why
a particular theorem is actually interesting, and it is not until you learn
enough of the ideas that you realize the answer. To get to this point, however,
is often a long and arduous process, and it is very easy to lose sight of the
big picture.  I have often felt that a roadmap could be beneficial, and
this is my attempt at one for basic functional analysis. The definitions and
theorems I present here follow the treatment from Folland's <a

<h3>Normed vector spaces</h3>

<p>One of the central objects at play in functional analysis is actually one
that many people have seen before from undergraduate linear
algebra courses.  A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normed_vector_space">normed vector space</a> 
$(X, \norm{\cdot})$ is a pair where $X$
is a vector space (over a scalar field $\F$) and $\norm{\cdot}$ defines a proper norm on $X$. When $X$ is
complete w.r.t. $\norm{\cdot}$, the space is called a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach_space">Banach space</a>. When the
norm of a Banach space is induced by an inner product (i.e. $\norm{x}^2 =
\ip{x}{x}$) for an inner product $\ip{\cdot}{\cdot}$, the space is called a
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hilbert_space">Hilbert space</a>.
</p>

<p>We are already quite familiar with examples of Banach and Hilbert spaces.
Let $X = \R^n$. Recall the $p$-norm on $X$ is defined as $\norm{x}_p = \left(
\sum_{i=1}^{n} \abs{x_i}^p \right)^{1/p}$.  We allow $p = \infty$, which we
interpret as $\norm{x}_\infty = \max_{1 \leq i \leq n} \abs{x_i}$.  When $p \in
[1, \infty]$, $(X, \norm{\cdot}_p)$ is a Banach space. The special case $(X,
\norm{\cdot}_2)$, also known as the Euclidean space, is a Hilbert space with
the usual inner product on $\R^n$ (i.e. $\ip{x}{y} = \sum_{i=1}^{n} x_i y_i$).
</p>

<p>If we stretch our imaginations just a little bit, we can define vector spaces over
functions. Let $C([0, 1])$ denote the space of continuous functions $f : [0, 1] \longrightarrow \R$.
From basic properties of continuous functions,
if $f, g \in C([0, 1])$ and $a \in \R$, then $f + g \in C([0, 1])$ and $a f \in C([0, 1])$.
Hence, $C([0, 1])$ defines a vector space. We can make $C([0, 1])$ into a normed space
by defining the norm $\norm{f}_\infty = \sup_{x \in [0, 1]} \abs{f(x)}$. Since $f$ is continuous
and $[0, 1]$ is a compact set, $\norm{f}_\infty < \infty$. It is easy to see that $\norm{\cdot}_\infty$
defines a valid norm.
</p>

<p>But we can say more. It is also not hard to see that $\norm{\cdot}_\infty$
makes $C([0, 1])$ a complete space. This amounts to checking that given a
sequence $\{f_n\}_{n=1}^{\infty}$ with $f_n \in C([0, 1])$ and
$\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \norm{f_n}_\infty < \infty$, the partial sums
$\sum_{n=1}^{N} f_n$ converge (in $\norm{\cdot}_\infty$, or equivalently
converge uniformly) to some $f \in C([0, 1])$ as $N \longrightarrow \infty$. This can be done by
observing that for each $x \in [0, 1]$, the series $\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f_n(x)$
is absolutely convergent, and therefore converges to some value in $\R$. Hence,
the definition $f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} f_n(x)$ makes sense, and one just has to show
that $f$ is indeed the correct limit.
</p>

<p>We have just constructed our first example of a Banach space over functions.
Of course, there is nothing special about the interval $[0, 1]$, and the same argument above
works to show that $C(X)$ is a Banach space for any compact $X \subset \R$.
A few more common examples are the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequence_space">sequence spaces</a> $\ell^p$ and the 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lp_space">function spaces</a> $L^p$:
$$
\begin{align*}
  \ell^p &= \{ (x_n)_{n=1}^{\infty} : \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \abs{x_n}^p < \infty \} \\
  L^p(X, \A, \mu) &= \{ f : X \longrightarrow \C : f \text{ is $\A$-measurable}, \int \abs{f}^p \; d\mu < \infty \} \:.
\end{align*}
$$
Slight technical note for the last example: the functions $f$ are actually
elements of the equivalence class which treats $f \sim g$ if $f = g$
$\mu$-almost everywhere; this is necessary to make $L^p$ a proper vector space.
Also, one can view $\ell^p$ as a special case of $L^p$ by setting $X = \N$,
$\A$ as the discrete $\sigma$-algebra on $\N$, and $\mu$ as the counting
measure, but sometimes it helps to distinguish the two cases.
</p>

<h3>Linear operators</h3>

<p>Vector spaces in isolation are not that interesting. It gets interesting
when we start to make vector spaces interact with one another. The most basic
way of doing this is by defining <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_map">linear operators</a> between
vector spaces.  A linear operator $T : X \longrightarrow Y$ between two vector
spaces is simply a map such that $T(x + y) = Tx + Ty$ for all $x, y \in X$ and
$T(a x) = a T(x)$ for all $a \in \F, x \in X$.
</p>

<p>There is a special class of linear operators, which we call <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_form">linear functionals</a>.  Given
a vector space $X$ over a field $\F$, a linear functional is a linear map $f :
X \longrightarrow \F$. Let us pause for a second to reflect on what a linear functional
looks like when $X = \R^n$ (and $\F = \R$). Let $\{e_i\}_{i=1}^{n}$ denote any
basis for $\R^n$. Then for any $x \in \R^n$, we can write $x = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \varphi_i(x) e_i$,
where $\varphi_i(x)$ denotes the $i$-th coordinate of $x$ in the basis.
Applying linearity,
$$
  f(x) = f(\sum_{i=1}^{n} \varphi_i(x) e_i) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \varphi_i(x) f(e_i) \:.
$$
That is, $f(x)$ is simply the inner product between the vector of coordinates $(\varphi_1(x), ..., \varphi_n(x))$
and the vector $(f(e_1), ..., f(e_n)) \in \R^n$. Furthermore, given any vector $c \in \R^n$,
$f(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \varphi_i(x) c_i$ defines a linear functional. Hence, we have fully
described the space of linear functionals on $\R^n$ by, essentially, $\R^n$. We will formalize this in
a moment.
</p>

<p>Continuing our example in the previous paragraph, if we consider $\R^n$ as the Euclidean space,
then for any linear functional $f$, by taking $\{e_i\}_{i=1}^{n}$ as the standard basis vectors,
we have for all $x \in \R^n$ by Cauchy-Schwarz,
$$
  \abs{f(x)} \leq \norm{(f(e_1), ..., f(e_n))}_2 \norm{x}_2 \:.
$$
Equivalently,
$$
  \sup_{\norm{x}_2 = 1} \abs{f(x)} \leq \norm{(f(e_1), ..., f(e_n))}_2 < \infty \:.
$$
A natural question to ask is then, does a linear functional always satisfy
$\sup_{\norm{x}_2 = 1} \abs{f(x)} < \infty$? In finite dimensions, yes, but
in infinite dimensions, this is not true. 
The easiest way to see this by taking on faith
that every vector space has a <a href="http://www-dimat.unipv.it/giulio/linkedmaterial/af/notaHamel.pdf">Hamel basis</a>,
and any Hamel basis of an infinite dimensional space is uncountable. 
Taking these two statements for granted, if $\{ e_\alpha \in X : \alpha \in A \}$ is 
a Hamel basis and $\{ c_\alpha \in \F : \alpha \in A \}$ is an unbounded set (which is possible since $A$ is uncountable), then
$$
  f(x) = f(\sum_{\alpha \in A} \beta_\alpha e_\alpha) = \sum_{\alpha \in A} c_\alpha \beta_\alpha \:,
$$
is a linear functional, but $\abs{f(e_\alpha)} = \abs{c_\alpha}\norm{e_\alpha}$ for every $\alpha \in A$.
Hence $\sup_{\norm{x}=1} \abs{f(x)} = \infty$. 
</p>

<p>
This motivates the following definition. A linear operator $T : X \longrightarrow Y$ is called
bounded if $\norm{T} := \sup_{\norm{x}_X=1} \norm{T(x)}_Y < \infty$. We can then check that the space
of all bounded linear operators, defined as
$$
  L(X, Y) = \{ T : X \longrightarrow Y : T \text{ linear}, \norm{T} < \infty \} \:,
$$
is itself a normed vector space with the norm $\norm{T}$. Even more is that, if $Y$ is a Banach
space, then so is $L(X, Y)$ (even if $X$ is <i>not</i> a Banach space).
A nice fact about boundedness is that it is equivalent to continuity for a linear operator.
</p>

<p><strong>Proposition.</strong>
Let $T$ be a linear operator between two normed vector spaces $X, Y$. The following are equivalent:<br/>
(a) $T$ is bounded. <br/>
(b) $T$ is continuous. <br/>
(c) $T$ is continuous at zero. <br/>
</p>

<h3>Dual spaces and the Hahn-Banach theorem</h3>

<p>
The special case of $L(X, \F)$ is given the name $X^*$, called the dual space
of $X$. As mentioned above, $X^*$ is always a Banach space.
Of course, one can apply this dualizing operation recursively, and
define $X^{**} = (X^{*})^*$ and so on. But now the question is,
does $X^*$ have any meaningful elements in it, other than the trivial $f \equiv 0$?
</p>

<p>
The affirmative answer to this question is one of the first key results in
functional analysis, called the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hahn%E2%80%93Banach_theorem">Hahn-Banach</a>
theorem. It comes in many forms, and I will state a useful form of it (but not
the most general).
</p>

<p><strong>Theorem (Hahn-Banach).</strong> Let $X$ be a normed vector space, and let
$M \subset X$ be a proper closed subspace. For all $x \in X \setminus M$, there
exists an $f \in X^*$ such that $f|_M \equiv 0$, $\norm{f} = 1$, and $f(x) = \dist(x, M) := \inf_{y \in M} \norm{x - y}$.
</p>

<p>
Applying the Hahn-Banach theorem to the subspace $M = \{0\}$, we conclude that
if $x \neq y$, then there exists an $f \in X^*$ such that $f(x) \neq f(y)$, that is,
the dual space <i>separates</i> points. This tells us that the dual space is a very abundant space, 
and is a useful way to study the underlying space $X$. The way I think about it is this:
in finite dimensions, we study a vector space directly, via coordinates and basis. For 
infinite dimensional spaces, coordinates and basis are unwieldy to work with; the more natural
tool to use is the dual space.
</p>

<p>
Now that we know the dual space is a useful concept, we can ask many questions about it.
First, let us define the evaluation functional 
$e_x : X^* \longrightarrow \F$ of a point $x \in X$ as $e_x(f) = f(x)$. It is clear by definition that
$e_x$ is linear. Furthermore, $\abs{e_x(f)} = \abs{f(x)} \leq  \norm{x} \norm{f}$, and hence
$e_x$ is bounded. That is, $e_x \in X^{**}$. This shows that there is a natural embedding
of $X$ into $X^{**}$ via $x \mapsto e_x$.  Is this embedding always surjective? The answer is no,
and a natural counter-example is to consider the subspace $c_0 \subset \ell^\infty$,
$$
  c_0 = \{ x \in \ell^\infty : \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} x_n = 0 \} \:.
$$
It turns out that $c_0^* \cong \ell^1$ and $(\ell^1)^* \cong \ell^\infty$
(both relations are consequences of theorems to be discussed shortly).  Hence,
$c_0^{**}$ is strictly larger than the natural embedding of $c_0$.
</p>

<p>
Moving forward, the following lemma leads nicely into our next discussion on
weak topologies.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Lemma.</strong> Let $X$ be a normed vector space and let
$B_X = \{ x \in X : \norm{x} \leq 1 \}$ denote the norm closed unit ball in $X$.
Then $B_X$ is compact iff $X$ is finite dimensional.
</p>

<p>In studying analysis, we know that compactness is a nice, strong property of a
set to exhibit. Unfortunately, in infinite dimensions, the topology defined by the
norm is in a sense always too strong. Since we are interested in studying infinite
dimensional spaces, the only way around this is to weaken the topology.
</p>

<h3>Weak and weak-* topologies</h3>

<p>We now define two closely related topologies. The first one is defined on a
normed vector space $X$. The <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_topology">weak topology</a> on $X$ is
defined to be the coarsest topology which makes all bounded linear functionals
continuous. Recall that a bounded linear functional is continuous in the norm
topology on $X$ by the proposition above. Therefore, the weak topology is by
definition weaker than the norm topology (hence its name).
</p>

<p>A closely related topology is defined on the dual space $X^*$. In similar
spirit, we define the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_topology#The_weak-.2A_topology">weak-*
topology</a> on $X^*$ to be the coarsest topology which makes the maps
$\{e_x\}_{x \in X}$ continuous. Since $X^*$ is itself a normed vector space, 
we can compare the weak topology on $X^*$ versus the weak-* topology on $X^*$.
Recalling from above that $e_x \in X^{**}$, we immediately have that 
the weak-* topology on $X^*$ is weaker than the weak topology on $X^*$.
This is a very confusing sentence to parse at first, but I assure you it follows
immediately from the definitions.
</p>

<p>We can compare the topologies by comparing what a convergent sequence means in
each topology. The notation $x_n \stackrel{w}{\rightharpoonup} x$ below reads
"$x_n$ converges weakly to $x$".
<ul>
<li>In the norm topology, $x_n \longrightarrow x$ means that $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \norm{x_n - x} = 0$. </li>
<li>In the weak topology, $x_n \stackrel{w}{\rightharpoonup} x$ means that for each $f \in X^*$, $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} f(x_n) = f(x)$.</li>
<li>In the weak-* topology, $f_n \stackrel{w^*}{\rightharpoonup} f$ means that for each $x \in X$, $\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} f_n(x) = f(x)$.</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>One can convince oneself that, for example, convergence in the norm topology implies convergence
in the weak topology (as we would expect, since it is a stronger topology).
</p>

<p>With these definitions in place, one of the basic results concerning weak topologies is the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banach%E2%80%93Alaoglu_theorem">Banach-Alaoglu</a> theorem.
</p>

<p><strong>Theorem (Banach-Alaoglu).</strong> Let $X$ be a normed vector space,
and $X^*$ its dual.  The unit ball $B_{X^*} = \{ f \in X^* : \norm{f} \leq 1
\}$ is compact in the weak-* topology.  If $X$ is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separable_space">separable</a>, then
$B_{X^*}$ is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequentially_compact_space">sequentially
compact</a> in the weak-* topology.
</p>

<p>Recall that $B_{X^*}$ is <i>not</i> compact in the norm topology (unless
$X^*$ happens to be finite dimensional).  This theorem tells us that we can
weaken the topology and regain compactness. 
</p>

<h3>$L^p$ duality</h3>

<p>In a previous paragraph, I explored the dual space of $(\R^n, \norm{\cdot}_2)$ and concluded that 
it was essentially $\R^n$. We now make this precise, in the context of $L^p$ spaces.
First, a definition. Given a $p \in [1, \infty]$, define $q$, the conjugate exponent of $p$, as
the solution to $1/p + 1/q = 1$ (if $p=1$, then $q=\infty$, and vice-versa).
</p>

<p>We first start with a very <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%C3%B6lder%27s_inequality">useful
inequality</a> by H&#246;lder.
</p>

<p><strong>Theorem (H&#246;lder).</strong> Let $(X, \A, \mu)$ be a measure space,
and let $f, g$ be $\A$-measurable complex valued functions. Fix a $p \in [1, \infty]$, 
let $q$ denote its conjugate exponent. Then,
$$
  \abs{\int f g \; d\mu}  \leq \norm{f}_p \norm{g}_q \:.
$$
Hence, if $f \in L^p(X, \A, \mu)$ and $g \in L^q(X, \A, \mu)$, then
$fg \in L^1(X, \A, \mu)$.
</p>

<p>From here on out we write $L^p = L^p(X, \A, \mu)$. Fixing a $p \in [1, \infty]$, define for any $g \in L^q$ the map
$I_g : L^p \longrightarrow \C$ as
$$
  I_g(f) = \int f g \; d\mu \:.
$$
H&#246;lder's inequality tells us that $I_g \in (L^p)^*$, and that
$\norm{I_g} = \norm{g}_q$ (the equality can be achieved). 
Hence, the map $g \mapsto I_g$ embeds
$L^q$ into $(L^p)^*$, preserving norms in the process. 
The following theorem establishes conditions on when
the map $g \mapsto I_g$ is a norm-preserving bijection (and hence
$(L^p)^* \cong L^q$).
</p>

<p><strong>Theorem.</strong> Let $(X, \A, \mu)$ be a measure space.
If either $p \in (1, \infty)$ or 
$p \in [1, \infty)$ and $\mu$ is $\sigma$-finite, then 
$(L^p)^*$ is isometrically isomorphic to $L^q$ via the map $g \mapsto I_g$.
</p>

<p>An immediate consequence of this theorem is that for $p \in (1, \infty)$, $L^p$ spaces
are reflexive. But $L^1$ and $L^\infty$ can cause some trouble.
Let us first discuss the dual of $L^\infty$, by considering the dual of $\ell^\infty$.
</p>

<p><strong>Lemma.</strong> There exists an element of $(\ell^\infty)^*$ which is not
in the image of $g \mapsto I_g$ under $\ell^1$.
</p>

<p><strong>Proof.</strong> Suppose not. Recall the definition of $c_0 \subset \ell^\infty$ above.
One can check that $c_0$ is a closed subspace and that $\mathbf{1} \not\in c_0$,
so by the Hahn-Banach theorem there exists an $f \in (\ell^\infty)^*$ such that $f|_{c_0} \equiv 0$
and $f(\mathbf{1}) \neq 0$. Now suppose that $f(x) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} x_n c_n$ for some
$(c_n)_{n=1}^{\infty} \in \ell^1$. For $n \geq 1$, let $e_n \in c_0$ satisfy $(e_n)_{m} = 1$ iff $n = m$.
But then $f(e_n) = c_n = 0$ for all $n \geq 1$, and hence
$f \equiv 0$, a contradiction.
</p>

<p>The counter-example for $(L^1)^*$ is a bit more involved, and I will not
discuss it here.  See this <a
href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/405357/when-exactly-is-the-dual-of-l1-isomorphic-to-l-infty-via-the-natural-map">thread</a>
for more details.
</p>

<h3>Dual of $C_0(X)$: Riesz representation theorem</h3>

<p>Earlier, we gave the example of $(C([0, 1]), \norm{\cdot}_\infty)$ as a
Banach space. Can we do the same thing we did for $L^p$ spaces and characterize
its dual? This is the subject of the <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riesz%E2%80%93Markov%E2%80%93Kakutani_representation_theorem">Riesz
representation</a> theorem.  It is especially interesting since it provides a
connection between topology and measure theory.
</p>

<p>To set up the scene, we start with a few definitions.
Let $X$ be a topological space, and consider the set
$$
  C_0(X) = \{ f : X \longrightarrow \C : f \in C(X), f \text{ vanishes at infinity} \} \:,
$$
where we say $f$ vanishes at infinity if for all $\varepsilon > 0$, the set
$\{ x \in X : \abs{f(x)} \geq \varepsilon \}$ is compact. We endow the space $C_0(X)$
with the supremum norm $\norm{\cdot}_\infty$.
</p>

<p>Next, a Borel measure $\mu$ on $X$ is called a Radon measure if for all Borel sets $E$ we have
outer regularity
$$
  \mu(E) = \inf\{ \mu(O) : O \supset E, O \text{ is open} \}
$$
and for all open sets $O$ we have inner regularity
$$
  \mu(O) = \sup\{ \mu(K) : K \subset O, K \text{ is compact} \} \:.
$$
</p>

<p>
We define a complex Borel measure $\mu$ to be Radon if $\abs{\mu}$ is Radon. 
The space $M(X)$ denotes the vector space of complex Radon measures with norm
$\norm{\mu} = \abs{\mu}(X)$ (this value is finite for complex measures).
</p>

<p>We now make similar observations as in the case of $L^p$ spaces.
For a $\mu \in M(X)$, define the map $I_\mu : C_0(X) \longrightarrow \C$ by
$$
  I_\mu(f) = \int f \; d\mu \:.
$$
Similar to the case of $L^p$ spaces, we have immediately that
$$
  \abs{I_\mu(f)} \leq \abs{\mu}(X) \norm{f}_\infty = \norm{\mu} \norm{f} < \infty \:,
$$
and hence the map $\mu \mapsto I_\mu$ embeds $M(X)$ into $C_0(X)^*$.  If $X$ is
a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Locally_compact_space">locally
compact</a> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hausdorff_space">Hausdorff
space</a>, then one can show that $\norm{I_\mu} = \norm{\mu}$ by using inner
regularity to approximate $X$ from below by a compact set $K$ with arbitrarily
close measure, and then applying <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urysohn%27s_lemma">Urysohn's lemma</a> to
obtain a continuous function $f$ supported on $K$ with $\norm{f}_\infty = 1$.
</p>

<p>From the other direction, the Riesz representation theorem gives us
conditions on when this embedding is actually an isometric isomorphism.  </p>

<p><strong>Theorem (Riesz representation).</strong> Let $X$ be a locally
compact Hausdorff space.  Let $I \in C_0(X)^*$. There exists a unique $\mu \in
M(X)$ such that $I(f) = \int f \; d\mu$ for all $f \in C_0(X)$. Furthermore,
$\norm{I} = \norm{\mu}$.  Hence, the mapping $\mu \mapsto I_\mu$ is an
isometric isomorphism between $M(X)$ and $C_0(X)^*$.
</p>

<p>I claim that we now have all the tools necessary to understand why,
as I stated earlier, $c_0^{**} = \ell^\infty$. I will leave the details 
for the reader.
</p>

<h3>In conclusion</h3>

<p>I have barely scratched the surface of functional analysis. There are many
interesting applications which I have not discussed, including Fourier
analysis.  I hope this post serves as an guide and some motivation for what one
might learn in a first year course in analysis.
