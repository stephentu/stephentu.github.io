I have concluded that complex analysts must have the titles with the best puns
out of all mathematicians.
</p>

<p>This post will briefly discuss some of the issues
surrounding complex differentiation, and supply some links for a more thorough
treatment.  I will not attempt to prove any statements; the references within
do a far better job.

<h3>Review of real and complex differentiation</h3>

<p>For a function $f : \R \longrightarrow \R$, we say that $f$ is 
differentiable at $x \in \R$ if the following limit exists
$$
  \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} \:.
$$
When this limit exists, this number is given the name $f'(x)$.
Observe that $f'(x)$ remains the same no matter how
$h$ approaches zero (otherwise the limit does not exist). On the
real line, $h$ can approach zero from below ($h \nearrow 0$) or
from above ($h \searrow 0$).
</p>

<p>We now let $f : \C \longrightarrow \C$. Consider the
same limit as before
$$
  \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h} \:,
$$
except now $h \in \C$. There is a lot more structure going on here.  For the
limit to exist, the limit must take on the same value no matter how $h$ tends
to zero. Thinking of $\C$ as $\R^2$ for a second, one sees that there are more
degrees of freedom for $h$ to tend to zero.  For example, writing $h = x + j
y$, $h$ could tend to zero by first taking $x$ to zero followed by $y$, or
vise-versa. Hence we should not be surprised that it is "harder" for a function
to be complex differentiable than it is real differentiable.  On the other
hand, when a function is complex differentiable, we can also expect more of it. 
More on this below.
</p>

<p>Examples of complex differentiable functions include $z, z^n, e^z$ on $\C$ and
$z^{-1}$ on $\C \setminus \{0\}$. 
On the other hand, $f(z) = \mathrm{Re}(z)$ and $f(z) = \overline{z}$ are nowhere 
complex differentiable.
</p>

<p>
If $U \subset \C$ is a open subset and for every $x \in U$ we have that $f$ is
complex differentiable at $x$, then we say that $f$ is <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holomorphic_function">holomorphic</a> on
$U$. 
</p>

<h3>Cauchy-Riemann equations</h3>

<p>
Let $u : \R^2 \longrightarrow \R$ and $v : \R^2 \longrightarrow \R$.
The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy%E2%80%93Riemann_equations">Cauchy-Riemann</a> equations are
the following partial differential equations
$$
  \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y}, \:\: \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x} \:.
$$
There is a nice connection between the Cauchy-Riemann equations, and whether or not a
function is complex differentiable. Writing $f(x, y) = u(x, y) + j v(x, y)$,
a <i>necessary</i> condition for $f$ to be complex differentiable at $z \in \C$
is that $f$ satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations at $z$. This is actually not hard to see,
and comes from setting the double limits equal
$$
  \lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} \lim_{\Delta y \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(z + \Delta x + j \Delta y) - f(z)}{\Delta x + j\Delta y} =
  \lim_{\Delta y \rightarrow 0} \lim_{\Delta x \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(z + \Delta x + j \Delta y) - f(z)}{\Delta x + j\Delta y} \:.
$$
On the other hand, if $f$ viewed as a function from $\R^2 \longrightarrow
\R^2$ is real differentiable at $z = (x, y)$, then if $f$ satisfies the
Cauchy-Riemann equations at $z$, then $f$ is complex differentiable at $z$.
</p>

<h3>Holomorphic functions are infinitely continuously differentiable</h3>

<p>The statement is that if $f$ is holomorphic on $U$, then so is
$f'$. A straightforward induction argument then recovers that
$f$ is infinitely complex differentiable on $U$. This is a mindblowing
statement, and is in stark contrast to real differentiation where it is very
easy to run into cases where a function only as a finite number of derivatives.
<a href="http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/640/why-are-differentiable-complex-functions-infinitely-differentiable">Here</a>
<a href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2013/08/20/why-are-differentiable-complex-functions-infinitely-differentiable/">are</a>
some intuitive explanations of why this is the case.
</p>

<h3>Real valued functions with complex arguments are (almost) never holomorphic</h3>

<p>This one is really interesting. Let $f : \C \longrightarrow \R$. Note that this
happens quite often in signal processing applications, when $f$ represents some cost
function, and optimization of $f$ over (some subset of) $\C$ recovers a signal of interest.
Typically, optimization is done via an iterative procedure which uses gradient information
to descend towards stationary points. However, it turns out that $f$ is not holomorphic anywhere,
unless $f$ is a constant function. This is a direct consequence of the Cauchy-Riemann equations
(convince yourself this is true).
</p>

<p>
Note that this is <i>not</i> to say that $f$ is not complex differentiable anywhere.
For instance, consider $f(z) = \abs{z}^2$. $f$ is actually complex differentiable at $z = 0$ 
(check the Cauchy-Riemann equations). But there is no neighborhood around zero which
$f$ is holomorphic on.
</p>

<p>However, there are workarounds. The most obvious one is to treat $f$ mapping
$\R^2 \longrightarrow \R$, and use real derivatives.  This works, but yields
quite messy expressions. A more elegant solution is the theory of <a
href="https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/631019/631019.pdf">Wirtinger calculus</a>.
By essentially a change of variables, one can define two differential operators
$$
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial z} = \frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} - j \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \right), \;\;
  \frac{\partial f}{\partial \overline{z}} = \frac{1}{2}\left( \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} + j \frac{\partial f}{\partial y} \right) \:.
$$
It turns out that if $f$ is differentiable in the real sense, then we have
the following substitute for a first order Taylor expansion in the complex sense
$$
  f(x + h) = f(x) + \begin{bmatrix} \frac{\partial f}{\partial \overline{z}}(x) \\ \frac{\partial f}{\partial z}(x) \end{bmatrix}^* \begin{bmatrix} h \\ \overline{h} \end{bmatrix}  + o(\abs{h}) \:.
$$
This suggests that we can consider $\frac{\partial f}{\partial \overline{z}}(x)$ as the steepest ascent direction at $x$.
The natural generalization of the gradient descent algorithm is therefore
$$
  z_{k+1} = z_{k} - \mu \frac{\partial f}{\partial \overline{z}}(z_{k}) \:.
$$
To appreciate the elegance of the Wirtinger derivative, try 
differentiating a function both ways and seeing which formula is cleaner
