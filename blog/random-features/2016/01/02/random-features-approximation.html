I am still not very comfortable in my understanding of random features and how
it relates to the original kernel. <a href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/4588-nystrom-method-vs-random-fourier-features-a-theoretical-and-empirical-comparison.pdf">This
paper</a> by Yang et al. attempts to put random features, the Nystrom method, and the regular
kernel machine on the same footing. I disagree somewhat on their interpretation
of random features in Equation (6) of the paper. This post will be my attempt
to elaborate.

</p>

<p>For the remainder of this post, let us fix a positive definite kernel
function $k : X \times X \rightarrow \R$, and we will let $\Hyp$ be the Hilbert
space of functions mapping $X \rightarrow \R$ associated with $k$. Given a
dataset $\{(x_i, y_i)\}_{i=1}^{n} \subset X^n \times \R$, let us focus our efforts
on kernel ridge regression, which solves the following problem
\begin{align}
  \min_{f \in \Hyp} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - f(x_i))^2 + \lambda \norm{f}_\Hyp^2 \:. \label{eq:krr}
\end{align}
The standard representer theorem argument tells us that our solution
$f$ takes on the form $f = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i k(x_i, \cdot)$, and hence
we can solve the following finite dimensional problem
\begin{align}
  \min_{\alpha \in \R^n} \norm{ K\alpha - Y }^2_2 + \lambda \alpha^T K \alpha \:, \label{eq:krr:rep}
\end{align}
where $K \in \R^{n \times n}$ satisfies $K_{ij} = k(x_i, x_j)$. The optimal $\alpha$
is given by solving the normal equation, yielding
\begin{align*}
  \alpha = (K + \lambda I_n)^{-1} Y \:. 
\end{align*}
Notice that a solution takes $O(n^3)$ time. Hence, it is often stated that
kernel methods are impractical for large scale learning (when $n$ grows into
the millions).  Notice also that an evaluation of $f(x)$ takes $O(n)$ time
(ignoring the dimension of $X$), and requires storage of the training dataset,
making it impractical for deploying the model on say, a smartphone. This is
because in standard kernel ridge regression, no sparsity of $\alpha$ is
enforced.
</p>

<p>Of course, since kernel methods are quite desirable, there have been some
solutions proposed to these issues in the literature. To deal with the training
time, one can use kernel approximations such as the Nystrom method (see e.g.
this excellent <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1303.1849">survey</a> by Gittens
and Mahoney), or random features (see e.g. the <a
href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~brecht/papers/07.rah.rec.nips.pdf">original
paper</a> on random features). To enforce sparsity in the resulting model, one
can use the hinge loss instead of squared loss (see e.g. this <a
href="http://alex.smola.org/papers/2003/SmoSch03b.pdf">tutorial</a> on SVR).
These methods all offer clear computational gains (the SVR trades computation at
evaluation time for computation at training time, since training an SVM is
in general slower than solving a least squares system). An important question, however,
is what are we giving up when we use an approximation to $\eqref{eq:krr}$? This is a hard
question, actually, and I will not attempt to do so here. However, I will try to shed some
light on what random features, specifically, is doing in view of $\eqref{eq:krr}$.
</p>

<p>Let me set up the framework of random features.  Interestingly, I will do
this in a deterministic manner. I will later explain how randomness comes into
the picture. Suppose we have some feature map $z : X \rightarrow \R^p$. Now, I
explicitly choose for $z$ to map into a finite dimensional space because we
want algorithms which we can implement on a computer to arise from this
discussion!  Furthermore, suppose that our feature map has the property that
$\ip{z(x)}{z(y)}_{\R^p} \approx k(x, y)$ for all $x, y \in X$. Then, we can
approximate $f = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i k(x_i, \cdot)$ as
$f \approx \sum_{i=1}^{n} \alpha_i \ip{z(x_i)}{z(\cdot)}_{\R^p}$. In other words,
we can define a new RKHS $\Hyp'$, with associated kernel $\widetilde{k}(x, y) := \ip{z(x)}{z(y)}_{\R^p}$,
and approximate the solution to $\eqref{eq:krr}$ with
\begin{align}
  \min_{f \in \Hyp'} \sum_{i=1}^{n} (y_i - f(x_i))^2 + \lambda \norm{f}_{\Hyp'}^2 \:. \label{eq:rf}
\end{align}
Using the same representer theorem argument, we get that program $\eqref{eq:rf}$ is equivalent to
\begin{align}
  \min_{\alpha \in \R^n} \norm{ ZZ^T\alpha - Y }^2_2 + \lambda \alpha^T ZZ^T \alpha \:, \label{eq:rf:rep}
\end{align}
where the $i$-th row of $Z \in \R^{n \times p}$ is $z(x_i)^T$. Comparing $\eqref{eq:krr:rep}$ to
$\eqref{eq:rf:rep}$, it becomes very clear that we are approximating $K$ with
$ZZ^T$.  The optimal $\alpha$ here is given by $\alpha = (ZZ^T + \lambda I_n)^{-1} Y$.
However, so far computationally we have not gained anything, as
solving $\eqref{eq:rf:rep}$ requires solving an $n \times n$ system. The key
here, though, is that we have explicitly computed the factor $Z$. Now, we can apply
a change of variables $w := Z^T \alpha$ to $\eqref{eq:rf:rep}$, and solve the following
program
\begin{align}
  \min_{w \in \R^p} \norm{ Zw  - Y }^2_2 + \lambda \norm{w}^2_2 \:. \label{eq:rf:primal}
\end{align}
Note that given a $w$, a function evaluation $f(x)$ is computed as $f(x) = \ip{z(x)}{w}_{\R^p}$.
We are in business now; the optimal solution is $w = (Z^T Z + \lambda I_p)^{-1} Z^T Y$, and
the computation required for training is $O(p^3)$ and for evaluation is $O(p)$ (ignoing the cost of computing $z(x)$). 
If $p \ll n$, this is a big saving! It is also instructive to compare the formulas for the vector
of predictions on the training set when solving $\eqref{eq:rf:rep}$ versus $\eqref{eq:rf:primal}$.
For $\eqref{eq:rf:rep}$, we get
$$
  \widehat{Y} = ZZ^T (ZZ^T + \lambda I_n)^{-1} Y \:,
$$
and for $\eqref{eq:rf:primal}$, we get
$$
  \widehat{Y} = Z(Z^TZ + \lambda I_p)^{-1} Z^T Y \:.
$$
This is actually a well known identity for matrix inverses, which you can find
in Section 3 of the <a
href="http://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf">matrix
cookbook</a>. Furthermore, the relationship between $\eqref{eq:rf:rep}$ and
$\eqref{eq:rf:primal}$ is exactly the idea of duality; see e.g. Wright's excellent
<a href="http://www.optimization-online.org/DB_FILE/2014/12/4679.pdf">survey paper</a>.
</p>

<p>In fact, I want to elaborate a bit more on the duality viewpoint I made in
the previous paragraph.  Above, we saw that there were two options to arrive at
the same solution $\widehat{Y}$, one which involved solving an $n \times n$
system, and one which involved a $p \times p$ system. Which one should we use?
Ideally, when $p < n$ we use the $p \times p$ system, and when $p > n$ we use
the $n \times n$ system.  Usually, when we are given a dataset of $n$ points,
each point of dimension $p$, we classically expect $n \gg p$ (I am ignoring
high-dimensional statistics for now).  However, when we use a kernel, we are
saying we want to take $p$ very large (possibly infinite). Hence, the dual
formulation of $\eqref{eq:krr:rep}$ is preferable (and when $p = \infty$, the
only way to solve the system on a computer).  But random features comes along
and takes us <i>back</i> to the primal formulation, and it does so by
truncating the feature expansion, via the $z$ map discussed above. This brings us to
the last point, how do we construct $z$? As you may have guessed already, this is
where randomness enters the picture.
</p>

<p>Recall that the one crucial property of $z$ we wanted to ensure was that
for all $x, y \in X$, we have $\ip{z(x)}{z(y)}_{\R^p} \approx k(x, y)$. So how
do we construct such a $z$? First, let $p = \infty$. Then, by taking the eigenfunction
expansion of $k$, we get for (almost) all $x, y$, 
$$
  k(x, y) = \sum_{i=1}^{\infty} \lambda_i \psi_i(x) \psi_i(y) \:,
$$
where $(\psi_i(\cdot))_{i=1}^{\infty}$ is an orthonormal basis for
square-integrable functions from $X \rightarrow \R$, and where
$(\lambda_i)_{i=1}^{\infty}$ is non-negative and summable. (This is just the
extension of an eigen-decomposition of a symmetric matrix to operators).
Hence, we have immediately that 
$$z(x) = (\sqrt{\lambda_1} \psi_1(x), \sqrt{\lambda_2} \psi_2(x), ...) \in \ell_2$$
satisfies our requirement for a feature map. Now there are two problems.
First, $\ell_2$ is infinite-dimensional. We can get around this by truncation,
say taking only the top-$p$ eigenfunctions. The second problem is, what are the
eigenfunctions?  Can we compute them, given an arbitrary kernel? For the
Gaussian kernel, we know the answer is the <a
href="https://charlesmartin14.wordpress.com/2012/10/18/data-spectroscopy/">Hermite
polynomials</a>.  For arbitrary kernels, to the best of my knowledge, this is
computationally expensive.
</p>

<p>
Random features sidesteps this issue, by supposing there exists
a distribution $\mathbb{P}$ on some set $\Omega$ and a real valued function $\varphi : \Omega \times X \rightarrow \R$
such that $k(x, y) = \E_{\omega} \varphi(\omega, x) \varphi(\omega, y)$, where the
expectation is taken w.r.t. $\mathbb{P}$. 

Under this assumption, constructing a feature map is easy; take i.i.d.
$\omega_1, ..., \omega_p$ from $\mathbb{P}$, and use the feature map $z(x) :=
\frac{1}{\sqrt{p}} ( \varphi(\omega_1, x), ..., \varphi(\omega_p, x) )$. Then
we have that 
$$
  \ip{z(x)}{z(y)}_{\R^p} = \frac{1}{p} \sum_{i=1}^{p} \varphi(\omega_i, x) \varphi(\omega_i, y) \:.
$$
If $\varphi$ is a bounded function, then this is nothing more than sum of
i.i.d. bounded random variables, for which a Hoeffding bound implies for fixed
$x, y \in X$, this quantity converges to $k(x, y)$ exponentially fast in $p$.
If we care about $\norm{ K - ZZ^T }_\infty \leq \epsilon$, then a simple union bound
suffices (at the expense of a $\log{n}$ factor).

To get convergence for all $x, y \in X$, a more involved argument is needed. If
you are interested, this <a
href="http://papers.nips.cc/paper/5740-optimal-rates-for-random-fourier-features.pdf">recent
paper</a> has finally gotten the optimal rates for uniform convergence of
random features.
</p>

<p>
Of course, random features is predicated on the existence of such a
distribution (that we can sample from). Fortunately, for translation invariant
kernels (i.e. $k(x, y) = k(x - y)$), Bochner's theorem tells that by taking the
inverse Fourier transform of $k(\cdot)$, (after scaling) the result will be a
positive measure. Of course, there is no guarantee that the transform will
result in an analytical expression, and also no guarantee we can efficiently
sample from the result. In a few known cases (such as, of course, the Gaussian
kernel), we can do this.  (But we could have already done this for Gaussians
using Hermite polynomials; I wonder if anybody has actually tried this and
compared it to random features).
</p>

<p>Another interesting question, which I leave unresolved for now, is if 
we can view <a href="http://www.machinelearning.org/archive/icml2009/papers/407.pdf">feature hashing</a>
in this same framework.
