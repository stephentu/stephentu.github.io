This post will look at a matrix generalization of Markov's inequality,
which I believe is due to 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/quant-ph/0012127">Ahlswede and Winter</a>.
In fact, what will be presented can be generalized to linear
operators acting on Hilbert spaces, but we will not be concerned with this formalism.
</p>

<p>
We start with some notation. For two symmetric matrices,
$A \preceq B$ means that the matrix $B - A$ is positive
semi-definite.
On the other hand, the notation $A \not\preceq B$ means that
$B - A$ is <i>not</i> positive semi-definite.
This is equivalent to $B - A$ having a strictly negative eigenvalue.
</p>

<p><strong>Lemma:</strong>
Let $A \succ 0$, and let $X$ be a random matrix such that
$X \succeq 0$ almost surely. Then,
$$
  \Pr( X \not\preceq A ) \leq \Tr(\E[X]A^{-1}) \:.
$$
</p>

<p>
Before we go through the proof, observe that when $X$ and $A$ are scalars,
this exactly reduces to Markov's inequality.
</p>

<p><i>Proof:</i>
The key inequality is the following:
$$
\begin{align}
  \ind_{X \not\preceq A} \leq \Tr( A^{-1/2} X A^{-1/2} ) \:. \label{eq:key_inequality}
\end{align}
$$
Let us see why this is true.
Since the right hand side is non-negative, if $X \preceq A$, then the inequality
trivially holds. Now suppose that $X \not\preceq A$.
This means there exists a $v \neq 0$ such that 
$v^\T (A - X) v < 0$.
Since $A$ is invertible, we can perform a variable substitution $q = A^{1/2} v$,
and conclude that
$$
  q^\T q - q^\T A^{-1/2} X A^{-1/2} q < 0 \Longleftrightarrow 
  \frac{q^\T A^{-1/2} X A^{-1/2} q}{q^\T q} > 1 \:.
$$
By the variational form of the maximum eigenvalue of a symmetric matrix,
$$
  \lambda_{\max}(A^{-1/2} X A^{-1/2}) = \sup_{w \neq 0} \frac{w^\T A^{-1/2} X A^{-1/2} w}{w^\T w} \geq \frac{q^\T A^{-1/2} X A^{-1/2} q}{q^\T q} > 1 \:.
$$
Since $A^{-1/2} X A^{-1/2}$ is positive semi-definite,
$$
  \Tr( A^{-1/2} X A^{-1/2} ) \geq \lambda_{\max}( A^{-1/2} X A^{-1/2} ) > 1 \:.
$$
This establishes $\eqref{eq:key_inequality}$.
Taking expectations of both sides of $\eqref{eq:key_inequality}$ we conclude
$$
  \Pr(X \not\preceq A) = \E\ind_{X \not\preceq A} \leq \E\Tr(A^{-1/2} X A^{-1/2}) = \Tr(A^{-1/2} \E[X] A^{-1/2}) = \Tr(\E[X] A^{-1}) \:.
$$
The penultimate equality holds by the linearity of trace, and
the last equality holds by the cyclic property of trace. $\square$

We will now generalize matrix Markov's inequality and recover a 
matrix Chebyshev's inequality.
To do this, however, we need a few preliminaries from matrix analysis.
First, we define what the operator $\abs{\cdot}$ does to a symmetric matrix.
If $A$ is a diagonal matrix, then $\abs{A}$ simply takes the
absolute value element-wise along the diagonal.
In the general case when $A$ is symmetric, $\abs{A} = U \abs{\Sigma} U^\T$,
where $A = U \Sigma U^\T$ is its eigen-decomposition.
From this, we immediately observe that
$\abs{A}$ is positive semi-definite, and 
$A^2 = \abs{A}^2$.
</p>

<p>Next, we will prove the following property regarding
positive semi-definite matrices. While the following fact
seems intuitive, it does require a careful proof.
</p>

<p><strong>Lemma:</strong>
Let $A, B$ be symmetric matrices, and suppose that $A^2 \preceq B^2$.
Then $\abs{A} \preceq \abs{B}$.
</p>

<p><i>Proof:</i>
This proof is motivated from <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/350188/square-root-is-operator-monotone">here</a>.
We first assume that $A$ and $B$ are positive semi-definite.
Furthermore, we assume that $B$ is positive definite.
We have the equivalence
$$
  A^2 \preceq B^2 \Longleftrightarrow B^{-1} A^2 B^{-1} \preceq I \:.
$$
Therefore, we have the following inequalities,
$$
\begin{align*}
  1 \stackrel{(a)}{\geq} \lambda_{\max}(B^{-1} A^2 B) = \sigma_{\max}^2( B^{-1} A) \stackrel{(b)}{\geq} \lambda_{\max}^2(B^{-1} A) \stackrel{(c)}{=} \lambda_{\max}^2(B^{-1/2} A B^{-1/2}) \:.
\end{align*}
$$
Above, (a) follows from the semidefinite relation $B^{-1} A^2 B^{-1} \preceq I$,
(b) follows since the operator norm $\norm{M}$ of a matrix $M$ dominates the spectral radius 
$\rho(M)$, and (c) follows since for two square matrices $M,N$, 
$\lambda(MN) = \lambda(NM)$, where $\lambda(\cdot)$ denotes the set of eigenvalues.
But this means that 
$$
  1 \geq \lambda_{\max}(B^{-1/2} A B^{-1/2})
  \Longleftrightarrow A \preceq B \:.
$$
Now we relax the assumption that $B$ is positive definite
via a limiting argument.
Let $B = U \Sigma U^\T$ denote the eigen-decomposition of $B$
(here, $U$ is orthonormal and hence $\Sigma$ can contain 
zeros along the diagonal).
Fix any $\varepsilon > 0$.
Clearly we have that $\Sigma^2 \preceq (\Sigma + \varepsilon I)^2$,
which follows since $(x + \varepsilon)^2 \geq x^2$ for any $x \geq 0$.
Conjugating both sides of this relation by $U$, we conclude that
$$
  B^2 = U \Sigma^2 U^\T \preceq U (\Sigma + \varepsilon I)^2 U^\T = (B + \varepsilon I)^2 \:.
$$
Therefore, if $A^2 \preceq B^2$ holds, then
so does $A^2 \preceq (B + \varepsilon I)^2$. Since
$B + \varepsilon I$ is positive definite by construction,
we conclude that $A \preceq B + \varepsilon I$.
Since this holds for every $\varepsilon > 0$, we conclude that
$A \preceq B$.
</p>

<p>Finally,
it remains to remove the assumption that both $A$ and $B$ are positive
semi-definite.
But since $A^2 \preceq B^2$ implies that $\abs{A}^2 \preceq \abs{B}^2$,
we have that $\abs{A} \preceq \abs{B}$. $\square$
</p>

<p>A few remarks about the last lemma are in order before we continue.
First, Bhatia gives an alternative proof in Proposition 1.2.9 of
one of his <a href="https://press.princeton.edu/titles/8445.html">books</a>
which is shorter, but more indirect.
Second, the converse is not true: $A \preceq B$ does not imply that $A^2 \preceq B^2$.
</p>

<p>We are now in a position to state and prove matrix Chebyshev's inequality.
</p>

<p><strong>Lemma:</strong>
Let $A \succ 0$, and let $X$ be a random matrix. Then,
$$
  \Pr( \abs{X} \not\preceq A ) \leq \Tr(\E[X^2] A^{-2}) \:.
$$
</p>

<p><i>Proof:</i>
By our preceding discussion we have that $X^2 \preceq A^2$ implies $\abs{X} \preceq A$,
and hence $\abs{X} \not\preceq A$ implies $X^2 \not\preceq A^2$.
By monotonicity of probability,
$$
  \Pr( \abs{X} \not\preceq A ) \leq \Pr( X^2 \not\preceq A^2 ) \leq \Tr(\E[X^2] A^{-2}) \:,
$$
where the last inequality follows from matrix Markov's inequality. $\square$
</p>

<p>At this point, you may be asking if there is anything special about Chebyshev's inequality.
In the scalar case the answer is no, since for any $p \geq 1$ and $t > 0$, we have that
$\Pr( \abs{X} > t ) \leq \frac{\E\abs{X}^p}{t^p}$.
Indeed, this also holds in the matrix case.
</p>

<p><strong>Lemma:</strong>
Let $A \succ 0$, and let $X$ be a random matrix. Fix any $p \geq 1$.
Then
$$
  \Pr( \abs{X} \not\preceq A ) \leq \Tr(\E[\abs{X}^p] A^{-p}) \:.
$$
</p>

<p><i>Proof:</i>
The key here is that the function $f(x) = x^a$ is operator monotone,
for any $a \in [0, 1]$. We proved this above in the special case when $a = 1/2$.
In the more general case, the proof is more technical.
See e.g. Theorem 2.3 <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1305.2471.pdf">here</a> for the details.
Now by setting $a = 1/p$, we have that
$\abs{X}^p \preceq A^p$ implies $\abs{X} \preceq A$. Hence as we did for matrix Chebyshev's inequality,
$$
  \Pr( \abs{X} \not\preceq A ) \leq \Pr( \abs{X}^p \not\preceq A^p ) \leq \Tr(\E[\abs{X}^p] A^{-p}) \:.
$$
$\square$
