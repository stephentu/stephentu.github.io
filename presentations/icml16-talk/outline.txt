* this talk focuses on the problem of LR matrix recovery

  min rank(X) : A(X) = b

  this formulation encompasses MC, PR, metric embedding


* HN slides

* We provide a procedure that, given only m=nr samples, under some conditions of A,
  we can estimate M to arbitrary accuracy. We call this PF.

  This is information theortic lower bound for certain As

* Introduce RIP

* State what is RIP

* Show PF procedure

* State more formal theorem
